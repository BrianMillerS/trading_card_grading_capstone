### Project Overview:
The condition of a trading card significantly influences its worth. However, the current methods to assess a card's condition are insufficient. Non-professionals often lack the accuracy required for card grading, and obtaining professional evaluations is too expensive and time-consuming for most transactions.

Thus this project aims to automate the card grading process using machine learning. 

### Data:
After quality control steps, 
All cards were downloaded from [Collectors.com](https://www.collectors.com/trading-cards/sport-baseball-cards/20003?lowgrade=1&highgrade=10&gradingservice=2&page=1)
